## Contentstack-Gatsby Static Site Demo

**About Contentstack**: Contentstack is a headless CMS with an API-first approach that puts content at the center. It is designed to simplify the process of publication by separating code from content.

**About this project**: This sample app is a demo on how to use [Contentstack’s](https://www.contentstack.com/docs) source plugin – gatsby-source-contentstack, along with Gatsby - a highly pluggable static site generator. Read more on how you can use its capabilities [here](https://github.com/contentstack/gatsby-source-contentstack).
